# Solver
Series of things I created while learning Kotlin, includes a Nash Equilibrium Solver for Texas Hold'em river situations, and
a calculator for win percentage given two player's possible hands. All Java files were borrowed from pokerbot-ai competition
for hand evaluation algorithms, I borrowed a lookup table method. First time the evaluator class is utilized, the lookup table will be generated.
